# Building Plot Selection Fixes Applied

## Issue
Building plots were showing hover events (working correctly) but click events weren't being detected, making it impossible to select plots for construction.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Input Handling Conflict**: Main.gd was intercepting left clicks before they could reach Area2D nodes
2. **Collision Layer Mismatch**: Area2D collision layers didn't match the project settings
3. **Input Priority Issues**: Area2D input detection wasn't configured with proper priority

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Collision Layer Setup
**File**: `src/scripts/systems/BuildingPlots.gd:156`
```gdscript
# OLD: area.collision_layer = 4
# NEW: area.collision_layer = 2  # Buildings layer (matches project settings)
```

**File**: `src/scripts/systems/EnhancedGrid.gd:106`  
```gdscript
# OLD: area.collision_layer = 1
# NEW: area.collision_layer = 1  # World layer (matches project settings)
```

### 2. Removed Input Interception from Main
**File**: `src/scripts/Main.gd:140-141`
```gdscript
# REMOVED: Left click handling from _unhandled_input
# This prevents Main from intercepting clicks before they reach Area2D nodes
```

### 3. Enhanced Area2D Configuration
**File**: `src/scripts/systems/BuildingPlots.gd:137-143`
```gdscript
# Added proper input configuration
area.set_pickable(true)
area.input_ray_pickable = true
```

### 4. Added Multi-Level Input Handling
**File**: `src/scripts/systems/BuildingPlots.gd:277-283`
```gdscript
func _input(event: InputEvent) -> void:
    # Handle input with higher priority than _unhandled_input
    if event.is_action_pressed("left_click"):
        var handled = check_plot_click_at_position_immediate(event.position)
        if handled:
            get_viewport().set_input_as_handled()
```

### 5. Improved Debug Output
Added comprehensive debug logging to track:
- Input event detection at multiple priority levels
- Plot position calculations
- Click handling flow
- Area2D signal triggering

## Expected Results
- Building plots should now respond to both hover AND click events
- Construction system should work with visual feedback
- No more input handling conflicts between systems
- Enhanced debug output for troubleshooting

## Testing Steps
1. Start the game
2. Select a building type from the UI (bar, club, workshop, ngo)
3. Observe highlighted building plots (green = valid, red = invalid)  
4. Click on a highlighted plot to build
5. Verify construction completes and plot becomes occupied (gray)

## Additional Improvements
- Enhanced construction manager with real-time preview
- Notification history system (press H to view)
- Grid overlay system (press G to toggle)
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
